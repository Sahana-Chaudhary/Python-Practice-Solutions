#can u change the values inside the list which is cintained in set s

s={8,7,12,'Harry', [1,2]}  

 #remember there is no indexing in sets

#no u cannot change values inside set because sets in python require all elements to be immutable and hashable
#list are mutable and not hashable thats why cant
#can use tuples because tuples are immutable and hashable
